# Math.Sound - Audio synthesizer based on mathematical functions, straight from your browser!

Math.Sound is a way to turn what you see into what you hear, using some math functions. Ever wanted to hear what a line sounds like as a piano? Or a circle as a marimba? Or both at the same time? Probably not, but now you can for free since someone else (me) did.
